Camenger
=============

Camenger is a personal messenger. You can send text to and from someone else that has this same app, provided you have a shared folder of some sort. Camenger saves the serialized string object to a file in your shared folder. The file can then be opened by Camenger and displayed to the user in plain text.

Note: Camenger only works with Java 8.
