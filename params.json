You can send text to and from someone else that has this same app, provided you have a shared folder of some sort. Camenger saves the serialized string object to a file in your shared folder. The file can then be opened by Camenger and displayed to the user in plain text.\r\n\r\nCamenger is a very basic messenger, and is one of my first projects on GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Install\r\n=============\r\nDownload the project in .zip or .tar.gz format.\r\n\r\nExtract the files.\r\n\r\nRun Camenger.jar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Camenger only works with Java 8.\r\n\r\nGet the latest JDK release here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html\r\n\r\nGet the latest JRE here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n============\r\nMy name is Cameron Lengerich.
