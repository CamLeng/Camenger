Camenger
=============

Camenger is a personal messenger. You can send text to and from someone else that has this same app, provided you have a shared folder of some sort. Camenger saves the serialized string object to a file in your shared folder. The file can then be opened by Camenger and displayed to the user in plain text.

Camenger is a very basic messenger, and is one of my first projects on GitHub.


How to Install
=============
Download the project in .zip or .tar.gz format.

Extract the files.

Run Camenger.jar



Note: Camenger only works with Java 8.
